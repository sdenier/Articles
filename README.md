This repository contains sources for my technical articles (starting with my work at Sogilis, on which [blog](http://blog.sogilis.com) they were originally published). They are fully readable here thanks to GitHub Markdown formatting.

- [Mixing Testing and Logging for a Better Developer Experience](testing_logging/testing_logging.md): some thoughts about how testing and logging can interact during development
- [Inline Comments: the Stuff that Pull Requests Are Made of](pull_requests_and_inline_comments/pull_requests_and_inline_comments.md): during the development of the [Tuleap](https://www.tuleap.org/) Pull Request plugin, we stumble upon the issue of updating inline comments for code reviews - a subject hard to grasp at first, but so rewarding once we figure out the model
- [The Distributed Reactive Loop: Handling Resiliency with a Simple Thought Framework](distributed_reactive_loop/distributed_reactive_loop.md): quite specific, but the description of how we manage the complexity of a distributed system for  3D printers
