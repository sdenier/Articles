Articles Yard
=============

This repository holds content and sources for my technical articles (starting with my work at Sogilis, on which [blog](http://blog.sogilis.com) most were originally published). They can be read on [GitHub Pages](http://sdenier.github.io/Articles/) or directly in the [repository](https://github.com/sdenier/Articles) in Markdown format.

Table of Contents
-----------------

- Découverte et amorçage de projet: 3 articles [[1]](capabilities_fr/article_storymap.md)[[2]](capabilities_fr/article_capabilities.md)[[3]](capabilities_fr/article_capabilities_lessons.md) fortement inspirés par ma lecture de Liz Keogh et Dan North sur notre expérience avec les Story Maps, la planification par capacités, "Deliberate Discovery" (french only)
- Demystifying Git: 2 articles [[1] Understand the Git Model](demystifying_git/demystifying_git1.md) - [[2] Do Everything with Git](demystifying_git/demystifying_git2.md) to describe a conceptual model of Git and ease the training process.
- [Mixing Testing and Logging for a Better Developer Experience](testing_logging/testing_logging.md): some thoughts about how testing and logging can interact during development
- [Inline Comments: the Stuff that Pull Requests Are Made of](pull_requests_and_inline_comments/pull_requests_and_inline_comments.md): during the development of the [Tuleap](https://www.tuleap.org/) Pull Request plugin, we stumble upon the issue of updating inline comments for code reviews - a subject hard to grasp at first, but so rewarding once we figure out the model
- [The Distributed Reactive Loop: Handling Resiliency with a Simple Thought Framework](distributed_reactive_loop/distributed_reactive_loop.md): quite specific, but the description of how we manage the complexity of a distributed system for  3D printers
