# Outline for common ideas vs next ideas

How "good practice" for agile planning are commonly misunderstoof and how to fix them.

## Users vs Stakeholders
Stakeholders,vision,goals --> beyond the features, what is important/at stake, how could we achieve/satisfy a goal when a feature reveals too complex


## Features vs Capabilities
BDD/Capabilities: how do people work, expression of needs/requirement --> beyond the features, what the system should do, without a focus on features/solution, keep options open

Event modeling? Event storming workshop? Build a shared understanding through a common model of what's going on in the system


## Story-based Planification vs Capabilities-based Planification
Planification with Value/Risk focus: Differentiator/Spoiler/Commodities, estimating complexity, uncertainty is the main risk, prioritization --> deliberate discovery, planning vs discovering ?


## Problem Resolution
Problem resolution & : Cynefin -> choice of solutions, think of other options, spike&stabilize


## Planification & Dependencies
Planification with dependencies: between capabilities, choice of alternate options for necessary commodities to demonstrate early value --> prototyping, early demo with value


## Story-based Estimation vs Expert-based Estimation
Estimation : give a gut feeling, get expert, it's an estimation, not an objective --> also keep track of resources (No estimate --> does not mean no accountability)
